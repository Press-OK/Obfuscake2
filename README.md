# Obfuscake2
A Python framework for recording and replaying user activity in a normal desktop environment

# Purpose
This was the 2nd iteration of an experiment to see how well user interaction with a computer could be recorded, manipulated, and replayed, with the intent being to obfuscate real user activity amongst a bunch of noise (for combatting keyloggers, web tracking, etc.). A strong imagination is required to find a practical purpose for such a thing.
